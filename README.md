# DFPedia
This is an image repository for the DF Pedia.

The folder layout should be mostly self-explanatory.

To upload files, navigate to the directory you want to upload in, and click Add file > Upload files. This page works like Imgur's upload (drag and drop images from your computer, or you can select them manually). After you're done picking what you want, click "Commit changes" to upload.

To delete a file, navigate to the file itself and click the trashcan above and to the right of the image preview, then click "Commit changes".
